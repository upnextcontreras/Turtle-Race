# Turtle Racing Game

Welcome to the **Turtle Racing Game**! This Python program uses the `turtle` module to simulate a fun and interactive turtle race where multiple turtles race to the finish line. You can run multiple rounds in a tournament, and each turtle leaves a trail as they move across the screen.

## Features
- **Multiple Rounds:** Set the number of rounds for the tournament.
- **Scoring System:** After each round, the winning turtle earns points, and the final scores are displayed at the end of the tournament.
- **Random Movements:** Each turtle's movement is randomized, making the race exciting and unpredictable.
- **Path Reset:** After each round, the paths drawn by the turtles are cleared, and the turtles return to the starting position.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
- **Turtle Module**: The turtle module is included in Python's standard library, so you don't need to install any additional dependencies.

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:
   ```bash
